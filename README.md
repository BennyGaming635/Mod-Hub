## Whats Mod Hub?
Mod Hub is a hub for all Minecraft Java Mods that are used in my friend groups Minecraft Server - Blue Topia. I found that having to constantly export a zip and send it was getting annoying so I made this!

## How to use?
Just try and break it. It made on GitHub Pages so good luck! Anyways it just links to CurseForge Mods and gives you a reason on why we use it.
